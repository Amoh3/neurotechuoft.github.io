Hello everyone!

Now that the NeurotechX Demo Day project has come to a close, it is time to start working on other projects that are planned for the upcoming term.

Talk about:
- new workshops project
- montreal demo day

Hi all,

With the closing of another week come exciting updates from the hardware and workshops teams at NeurotechUofT!

Developments are underway for the technical workshops coming up next term. These workshops will be structured around work on a mini project that will record muscle signals from one individual and apply them to another individual as a way to mirror muscle movements. At the moment, the team is sourcing materials and designing the schematics of the circuit board that will be needed for this mini project. In November, testing will begin.

The hardware team has also been working hard on the biosignals board project that will be challenged in the NeurotechX competition. The circuit diagram that outlines the chip's connection to Arduino is now complete and the circuit itself has been connected. Debugging is the task at hand before dry electrodes can be attached and the chip to Arduino connection is finalized.

Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: Planning is underway for a mini project that will be the foundation for upcoming workshops. The biosignals board team is working on establishing a secure connection between the TGAM chip and Arduino.

Hello there!

The team has started the Mindfulness Study - a research endeavour that observes different meditation techniques and documents the corresponding biofeedback of study participants. The aim of this study is to create and optimize a program that will allow a user to progress into a meditative state. Brainwave data, blood oxygenation levels, etc. are used to form a picture of individual's mental state, which helps the user meditate better.

The Wall-EEG mind controlled bot is able to obtain and graph signals from the OpenBCI but noise is still an issue. It has been noticed that the source of the noise is improper electrode-to-skin contact. Furthermore, the OpenBCI GUI processes much better than our team's code. What remains to be done is studying the OpenBCI GUI to find out what processing techniques are used before we start working to improve our own code. We are almost done choosing a technique, and are in the process of testing it in real time.

Thanks for reading!
