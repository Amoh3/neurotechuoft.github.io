            <p>TL;DR</p>
            <p>- Planning is underway for a mini project that will be the foundation for upcoming workshops </p>
            <p>- The biosignals board team is working on establishing a secure connection between the TGAM chip and Arduino </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hi all,

            With the closing of another week come exciting updates from the hardware and workshops teams at NeurotechUofT! </p>

            <p> Developments are underway for the technical workshops coming up next term. These workshops will be structured around work on a mini project that will record muscle signals from one individual and apply them to another individual as a way to mirror muscle movements. At the moment, the team is sourcing materials and designing the schematics of the circuit board that will be needed for this mini project. In November, testing will begin. </p>

            <p> The hardware team has also been working hard on the biosignals board project that will be challenged in the NeurotechX competition. The circuit diagram that outlines the chip's connection to Arduino is now complete and the circuit itself has been connected. Debugging is the task at hand before dry electrodes can be attached and the chip to Arduino connection is finalized. </p>

            <p> Thanks for reading! </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>TL;DR</p>

            <p>-Started the Mindfulness Study (biofeedback-based meditation)</p>
            <p>-WallEEG: noise coming from electrodes; still problems with signal processing algs</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p> Hello there!

            The team has started the Mindfulness Study - a research endeavour that observes different meditation techniques and documents the corresponding biofeedback of study participants. The aim of this study is to create and optimize a program that will allow a user to progress into a meditative state. Brainwave data, blood oxygenation levels, etc. are used to form a picture of individual's mental state, which helps the user meditate better. </p>

            <p> The Wall-EEG mind controlled bot is able to obtain and graph signals from the OpenBCI but noise is still an issue. It has been noticed that the source of the noise is improper electrode-to-skin contact. Furthermore, the OpenBCI GUI processes much better than our team's code. What remains to be done is studying the OpenBCI GUI to find out what processing techniques are used before we start working to improve our own code. We are almost done choosing a technique, and are in the process of testing it in real time. </p>

            <p> Thanks for reading! </p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>TL;DR</p>

            <p>-</p>
            <p>-We have a software team for WallEEG Mind-Controlled Bot!</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>Hey everyone! We've spent the past two weeks doing lots of admin stuff, and we're excited to say that NeurotechUofT has a lot of exciting things in store for the upcoming year!</p>

            <p>We're diving deep into literature for the Mindfulness Study, and we're planning how to develop our Biosignals Board. These two projects are for November 19th's NeuroTechX Student Competition which will take place in Montreal. We'll also continue WallEEG, but our main focus for the semester is the competition.</p>

            <p>A major problem we faced last year with were massive bugs in our projects. To combat this, we're creating The Secret Lab project. They will design and extensively test experimental techniques that can be used by any of our projects. Right now we're working on a general framework to bridge the OpenBCI, GUIs, and signals processing toolboxes. This could be used in both the Mindfulness Study and the WallEEG projects.</p>

            <p>We're also making new ways to help you become the ultimate neurotech ninja! We will have lots of interactive workshops coming up to introduce you to the various aspects of neurotech. This year we will introduce advanced workshops to help you use the various tools and techniques available. This will include workshops on the OpenBCi, signal processing, etc.</p>

            <p>(talk about field trips)</p>

            <p>On the administrative side, our team's hard at work to build industry partnerships so that we can see all the cool neurotech innovations happening in the real world. The hardware we bought last semester is finally trickling in, and we're really excited to use all of it!</p>
            <p>NEXT STEPS: </p>
            <p>-finish putting the pieces of the bot together!</p>
            <p>-find a cool project to work on for NeurotechX's competition</p>


            <p>That's all for now; stay tuned!</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>Hey everyone! Thanks for everyone who came out to our software scrum! The WallEEG project is well on its way, and we're working on putting all the pieces together. We're also forming our team to make a biosignals board for NeurotechX's Student Competition. Finally, we are collaborating with NeurotechTO on a software project of our own!</p>

            <h3>March 30, 2016</h3>

            <p>TL;DR</p>

            <p>-Bot Meeting 2: we tried modifying our Python script to run on Mac with mixed results; we're going to try again on Linux</p>
            <p>-We received a 32-bit 8-channel OpenBCI board! :O (Courtesy of <a href="http://www.openbci.com/">OpenBCI</a>, those guys are absolutely amazing &hearts;) </p>
            <p>-thinking of having study/chill sessions in April so we can learn from each other and help each other out; comment your thoughts beloow :D</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>Hey everyone! Hope you had a great time at BOT MEETING #2!! With all the last submissions and exams crawling around the corner, we'd like to appreciate your effort in joining us for this event. In case you weren't able to make it, here are the highlights!</p>

            <p>We're still having issues getting data from the Muse into our Python script; Sayan couldn't install Linux on his laptop for some weird reason. Luckily a member's Mac came to the rescue and so we tried rewriting our code for Mac but problems came along the way when installing the OSC library. On the bright side we discussed what we should buy for our box of things, but don't worry, we'll keep you posted on that! We also realized that it would be a great idea to start programming the bot to move on the controller's eye blinks before working on concentration/calmness. (This is because muscle signals are very large, and can easily be picked up without doing any signal processing).</p>
            <p>Also, amazing news! <a href="http://www.openbci.com/">OpenBCI</a> is loaning us the 32-bit 8-channel version of the Ganglion board!! It's a research grade board that can take EEG, EMG, ECG, and other signals and output it in a format that programs can read. We're going to be using this, and a full EEG headset to mind-control our bot. (Cool. )</p>
            <p>We're also thinking about having study/chill sessions during our meeting times for April (because we know you're all busy with exams). The idea would be that since a lot of us are taking courses that relate to neurotechnology, we could study and perhaps learn from each other. We could also help each other out on concepts we're stuck in! What do you all think? Comment on the Facebook group!</p>

            <p>PS: Really sorry for the lack of updates between December and now; we were going through lots of administrative stuff and trying to get funding and trying to expand our admin team. Between last December and now, we've held workshops on EEG, signal processing, and neurology, and we're well on our way to make our BCI bot! We also hosted a field trip and had presentations and discussion with one of <a href="http://eplink.ca/">EpLink's</a> labs (Thanks EpLink :D). We got to meet their team and learn about the work they are doing. We got a booth at the UTSU Winter Clubs Fair and had an amazing turnout there. Super excited for what's to come!</p>

            <p>NEXT STEPS: </p>
            <p>-installing Ubuntu (an open source software platform that can run on any device) so that our Python script can pick up data from the Muse and analyze it</p>


            <p>That's all for now! Good luck on exams!!</p>
            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>Best,</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>First of all, congratulations to everyone for finishing another semester of university! I hope exams went well for all of you, and that you have an awesome break.</p>

            <p>Since our last update, we've done some awesome things! We had a field trip to NeurotechTO's Developing EEG Technologies Meetup, where we learned a bit about the physiological side of BCI and had a great discussion about what we want to achieve with BCI. We also had our Programming Crash Course yesterday, where we learnt the basics of programming and had some really good pizza (thanks to Pizza Pizza! :D). We're also officially a UTSU Club, and we're making lots of progress in securing funds for the projects we have in mind for next semester.</p>

            <p>(Small reminder: we will be using Gitter officially starting January 11th, so get an account and join our room!)</p>

            <p>We have another field trip coming up! The Chill and A-Muse Night will be a relaxing way to celebrate finishing Fall semester, and a nice way to start the Winter semester. The event will take place at Bampot Bohemian House of Tea, and will feature lots of soothing teas, delicious Mediterranean snacks, board games, and (very) comfy pillows! We'll also have our two Muse EEG sets so you can meditate with the Muse Calm app. The event will cost $15 per person. Please <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/149546102079404/" target="_blank">RSVP here</a> by January 7th (say 'Going' if you can go / 'Can't Go' if you can't go):  </p>

            <p>For those of you who came to the Programming Crash Course, we hope you had fun! <a href="https://prezi.com/m2xn-7jiplxl/programming-crash-course/" target="_blank">Here is the Prezi and exercises we completed.</a> PM me on Facebook or Gitter for suggestions for future events like this. Again, programming isn't something you can learn in one day; it is something that must be practiced over a long time. I posted some resources on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1176994042329393/" target="_blank">Programming Crash Course event page</a>.</p>

            <p>In our last meeting, we discussed some of the projects we could develop, and decided that we would start off by making a simple app that graphs EEG signals from the Muse. We decided that we could think of more advanced projects in the future. However, these projects will cost money (and lots of it), and it would be very nice if we could get some of the money for these projects from UTSU and other sources. Therefore, we're working on planning this year's budget, which is necessary for fund applications (and for good administration!). For this, we need to know how much our projects will cost, and therefore what projects we will do. If you have an idea you want to do, please write <a href="http://1drv.ms/1malIBf" target="_blank">a small description like this</a> and send it to <a href="mailto:neurotechuoft@outlook.com">neurotechuoft@outlook.com</a>. Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>That's all for today; hope you all enjoy your break!</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>We had our second meeting last Monday! Thank you to all of you who came out; we had a great discussion about what projects we want to start off with, and about how to move forward with the group. Check the <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OcIb9p">NeurotechUofT OneNote</a> for meeting notes as usual.</p>

            <p>We're also having a field trip on Thursday! We will go to NeurotechTO's Developing EEG Technologies Meetup, where we will learn about developing BCI's and meet lots of cool people! We will meet at St. George Station, Southbound Platform at 6:00pm, and leave at 6:10pm sharp, and make our way together to the meetup. If you want to go there by yourself, here is the address and map (but it's more fun going as a group! :D) :</p>

            <p>ADDRESS: 106 Front Street East, Suite 200</p>

            <p>For those of you who have never programmed before, or want to review the basics of programming, we will have a Programming Crash Course on Monday December 7, 2015 from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. We will be touching upon the material that is found in a first year Intro to Programming course (ie: CSC108). The notes will be posted online, but we will be going over examples as a group and in pairs, so you'll learn better if you come!</p>

            <p>NOTE: The only way you can master coding is to PRACTICE. We are doing this so that you have a head start with the concepts, so that you can practice over the break in time for next semester when we start working on some basic projects. We will be posting great resources on our website and on this group for your use.</p>

            <p>Facebook has served us decently nicely as a messaging platform, but in the future we want to facilitate conversations for idea generation and helping each other out with projects In general, for strengthening our community in general, and for making the execution of this group easier. For these reasons, we will be using Gitter as our primary tool for online conversation!</p>

            <p>Gitter is an online messaging app which is a part of a larger service called GitHub. We will be using GitHub a lot when we start creating projects, because it is a very useful way of keeping track of how your software changes, and very useful for team software development. (Also, most software employers want to look at your GitHub to see what type of code you've written, so it's a nice way to showcase your work!) Gitter will be useful to us because we can have topic-specific rooms (ie: general, random, ideas, etc) to organize our conversation. To join Gitter, first create a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub account here</a>. Then take a look at <a href="https://gitter.im/neurotechuoft?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link" target="_blank">NeurotechUofT's Gitter</a> and join the rooms you want :D . Please join the General room, as we will post all updates and administrative messages there.</p>

            <p>This is all for now, but we will be posting a lot more about some of the things that were mentioned in our last meeting, and about what's coming up next semester.</p>

            <br>&nbsp;</br>

            <p>-check out our <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OATdZa" target="_blank">long-term and short-term goals!</a></p>

            <p>-our first meeting's this Monday! (the 16th) Stay tuned for more details!</p>

            <p>-what we've done: recognition from Ulife, website online, detailed plan for the next month-ish (with help from NeurotechTO)</p>

            <p>-what we're going to do: obtain a Muse from InteraXon for hack night, get bank account, start funding applications</p>

            <p>-if you want to help out with running NeurotechUofT, fill out <a href="http://1drv.ms/1MK3uvB" target="_blank">this short form</a> :D   Your help is very much appreciated!</p>
                    <br>&nbsp;</br>


            <p>It's great to see so many people enthusiastic about the field of neurotech! Thank you all for joining us in our mission to create a lively neurotech community at U of T.</p>

            <p>Also, thank you all to those who responded to the question about what you want to achieve from participating in NeurotechUofT. I read the responses, and used my visions, as well as the visions expressed in the survey, to create long-term and short-term goals for NeurotechUofT. They are stated, and explained in the this <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OATdZa" target="_blank">document!</a> :D</p>

            <p>So far, we've achieved recognition from Ulife, touched base with NeurotechTO (our parent organization in Toronto with the shared goal of creating a neurotech community in Toronto), and have some neat stuff planned for the future. We also have a <a href="http://neurotechuoft.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a> up! (yay :D). Over the next week, we want to open a bank account to a) reduce the chance of a conflict-of-interest situation, and b) to fulfill the requirements needed to apply for UTSU recognition (and funding). We're also going to look into and apply for funding sources. We're shaping up to have a meeting this Monday (the 16th), so stay tuned for more details!</p>

            <p>One last thing: there's a lot of behind-the-scenes work that's essential to keep NeurotechUofT alive and thriving. This includes web development, fund acquisition, organizing workshops, and more. If you're interested in helping out, give us your name, and answer a few questions in <a href="http://1drv.ms/1MK3uvB" target="_blank">this short form</a>! :D It's a great way to gain hands-on experience with operating an organization, and will help you refine your management, administrative, and leadership skills. Your contributions will help NeurotechUofT achieve its goals, and will help create a strong neurotechnology community at U of T. (And you can even add your experience to your resume!)</p>
