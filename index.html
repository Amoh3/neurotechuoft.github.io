        <p>It's great to see so many people enthusiastic about the field of neurotech! Thank you all for joining us in our mission to create a lively neurotech community at U of T.</p>

        <p>Also, thank you all to those who responded to the question about what you want to achieve from participating in NeurotechUofT. I read the responses, and used my visions, as well as the visions expressed in the survey, to create long-term and short-term goals for NeurotechUofT. They are stated, and explained in the this <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OATdZa">document!</a> :D</p>

        <p>So far, we've achieved recognition from Ulife, touched base with NeurotechTO (our parent organization in Toronto with the shared goal of creating a neurotech community in Toronto), and have some neat stuff planned for the future. We also have a <a href="http://neurotechuoft.github.io/">website</a> up! (yay :D). Over the next week, we want to open a bank account to a) reduce the chance of a conflict-of-interest situation, and b) to fulfill the requirements needed to apply for UTSU recognition (and funding). We're also going to look into and apply for funding sources. We're shaping up to have a meeting this Monday (the 16th), so stay tuned for more details!</p>

        <p>One last thing: there's a lot of behind-the-scenes work that's essential to keep NeurotechUofT alive and thriving. This includes web development, fund acquisition, organizing workshops, and more. If you're interested in helping out, give us your name, and answer a few questions in <a href="http://1drv.ms/1MK3uvB">this short form</a>! :D It's a great way to gain hands-on experience with operating an organization, and will help you refine your management, administrative, and leadership skills. Your contributions will help NeurotechUofT achieve its goals, and will help create a strong neurotechnology community at U of T. (And you can even add your experience to your resume!)</p>
        <br>&nbsp;</br>
        <p>Cheers,</p>
        <p>Sayan Faraz</p>
