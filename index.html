        <p>We had our second meeting last Monday! Thank you to all of you who came out; we had a great discussion about what projects we want to start off with, and about how to move forward with the group. Check the <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OcIb9p">NeurotechUofT OneNote</a> for meeting notes as usual.</p>
        
        <p>We're also having a field trip on Thursday! We will go to NeurotechTO's Developing EEG Technologies Meetup, where we will learn about developing BCI's and meet lots of cool people! We will meet at St. George Station, Southbound Platform at 6:00pm, and leave at 6:10pm sharp, and make our way together to the meetup. If you want to go there by yourself, here is the address and map (but it's more fun going as a group! :D) :</p>
        
        <p>ADDRESS: 106 Front Street East, Suite 200</p>

        <p>For those of you who have never programmed before, or want to review the basics of programming, we will have a Programming Crash Course on Monday December 7, 2015 from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. We will be touching upon the material that is found in a first year Intro to Programming course (ie: CSC108). The notes will be posted online, but we will be going over examples as a group and in pairs, so you'll learn better if you come!</p>
        
        <p>NOTE: The only way you can master coding is to PRACTICE. We are doing this so that you have a head start with the concepts, so that you can practice over the break in time for next semester when we start working on some basic projects. We will be posting great resources on our website and on this group for your use.</p>
        
        <p>Facebook has served us decently nicely as a messaging platform, but in the future we want to facilitate conversations for idea generation and helping each other out with projects In general, for strengthening our community in general, and for making the execution of this group easier. For these reasons, we will be using Gitter as our primary tool for online conversation!</p>
        
        <p>Gitter is an online messaging app which is a part of a larger service called GitHub. We will be using GitHub a lot when we start creating projects, because it is a very useful way of keeping track of how your software changes, and very useful for team software development. (Also, most software employers want to look at your GitHub to see what type of code you've written, so it's a nice way to showcase your work!) Gitter will be useful to us because we can have topic-specific rooms (ie: general, random, ideas, etc) to organize our conversation. To join Gitter, first create a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account here</a>. Then take a look at <a href="https://gitter.im/neurotechuoft?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link">NeurotechUofT's Gitter</a> and join the rooms you want :D . Please join the General room, as we will post all updates and administrative messages there.</p>
        
        <p>This is all for now, but we will be posting a lot more about some of the things that were mentioned in our last meeting, and about what's coming up next semester.</p>

        <p>TLDR:</p>
        
        <p>-check out our <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OATdZa">long-term and short-term goals!</a></p>
        
        <p>-our first meeting's this Monday! (the 16th) Stay tuned for more details!</p>
        
        <p>-what we've done: recognition from Ulife, website online, detailed plan for the next month-ish (with help from NeurotechTO)</p>
        
        <p>-what we're going to do: obtain a Muse from InteraXon for hack night, get bank account, start funding applications</p>
        
        <p>-if you want to help out with running NeurotechUofT, fill out <a href="http://1drv.ms/1MK3uvB">this short form</a> :D   Your help is very much appreciated!</p>
                <br>&nbsp;</br>
    
    
        <p>It's great to see so many people enthusiastic about the field of neurotech! Thank you all for joining us in our mission to create a lively neurotech community at U of T.</p>

        <p>Also, thank you all to those who responded to the question about what you want to achieve from participating in NeurotechUofT. I read the responses, and used my visions, as well as the visions expressed in the survey, to create long-term and short-term goals for NeurotechUofT. They are stated, and explained in the this <a href="http://1drv.ms/1OATdZa">document!</a> :D</p>

        <p>So far, we've achieved recognition from Ulife, touched base with NeurotechTO (our parent organization in Toronto with the shared goal of creating a neurotech community in Toronto), and have some neat stuff planned for the future. We also have a <a href="http://neurotechuoft.github.io/">website</a> up! (yay :D). Over the next week, we want to open a bank account to a) reduce the chance of a conflict-of-interest situation, and b) to fulfill the requirements needed to apply for UTSU recognition (and funding). We're also going to look into and apply for funding sources. We're shaping up to have a meeting this Monday (the 16th), so stay tuned for more details!</p>

        <p>One last thing: there's a lot of behind-the-scenes work that's essential to keep NeurotechUofT alive and thriving. This includes web development, fund acquisition, organizing workshops, and more. If you're interested in helping out, give us your name, and answer a few questions in <a href="http://1drv.ms/1MK3uvB">this short form</a>! :D It's a great way to gain hands-on experience with operating an organization, and will help you refine your management, administrative, and leadership skills. Your contributions will help NeurotechUofT achieve its goals, and will help create a strong neurotechnology community at U of T. (And you can even add your experience to your resume!)</p>
        <br>&nbsp;</br>
        <p>Cheers,</p>
